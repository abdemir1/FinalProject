# FinalProject

CET322 Final Project by Ayse Basak Demir. RecipeCo.

This is an asp.net core 5.0 web application project for my course CET322. 

  The application is a food blog where you can read recipes from the users of the blog. 
If you want to search some recipe or post your recipes you need to register. Then you can 
enjoy the food blog RecipeCo.
  
  When you register the blog, you can add different categories and then you can publish 
your recipes based on that categories. Don't forget, no one can edit your recipes its all
yours. The Search part becomes available if you login the blog. Otherwise you can only read
the recipes that are on the home page.
